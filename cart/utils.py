    Retrieves or creates a shopping cart for the authenticated user.

    This function ensures that every authenticated user has a unique, active cart. If a cart already exists 
    for the user (and it has not been marked as deleted), it retrieves that cart. Otherwise, it creates a new 
    cart instance associated with the user. This function uses Djangoâ€™s `get_or_create` method for efficient 
    querying and creation if necessary.

    Decorators:
        @login_required: Ensures that the user is authenticated before accessing or creating a cart. 
                         Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

    Parameters:
        - request (HttpRequest): The HTTP request object, which includes the authenticated user information.

    Returns:
        Cart: The existing or newly created Cart instance associated with the authenticated user.
