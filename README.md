## Marketing Strategy for Future Flower Shop
## Testing and Limitations

Due to being sick for 20 days, detailed testing of the platform could not be completed as planned. The testing process will be finalized after the assessment by Code Institute and the completion of grading. However, the application has been tested for its core functionality and is fully operational. All essential features, such as product browsing, cart management, and checkout, have been verified and work as expected. Please note that the management features (admin dashboard and certain backend operations) were not fully tested, but no critical issues have been identified within the customer-facing components.

For more information on features and testing, please refer to the [Testing Documentation](documentation/testing.md).

### Social Media Presence
We will maintain an active **Facebook page** to engage with our community of gardening enthusiasts, share seasonal promotions, and provide expert gardening tips. Our Facebook page will help us connect with customers and grow our online presence. Users will be able to follow us for the latest updates on new seed arrivals, special discounts, and valuable gardening advice.
