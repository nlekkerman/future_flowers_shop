## Marketing Strategy for Future Flower Shop

## Testing and Limitations

Due to being sick for 20 days, detailed testing of the platform could not be completed as planned. The testing process will be finalized after the assessment by Code Institute and the completion of grading. However, the application has been tested for its core functionality and is fully operational. All essential features, such as product browsing, cart management, and checkout, have been verified and work as expected. Please note that the management features (admin dashboard and certain backend operations) were not fully tested, but no critical issues have been identified within the customer-facing components.

For more information on features and testing, please refer to the [Testing Documentation](documentation/testing.md).

### Social Media Presence

We will maintain an active **Facebook page** to engage with our community of gardening enthusiasts, share seasonal promotions, and provide expert gardening tips. Our Facebook page will help us connect with customers and grow our online presence. Users will be able to follow us for the latest updates on new seed arrivals, special discounts, and valuable gardening advice.

### SEO Optimization

We will implement robust **SEO strategies** to enhance the visibility of Future Flower Shop in search engines. Our on-site SEO will be built around **dynamic meta descriptions** and **keywords** tailored to the specific products and categories offered on the platform. The following SEO strategies will be in place:

- **Meta Descriptions:** Each page will include a unique meta description that provides a compelling reason for customers to visit, such as, "Learn how to grow beautiful roses from seeds with our step-by-step guide" or "Discover expert tips for rose seed germination."
- **Dynamic Meta Keywords:** Keywords such as “buy seeds online,” “Future Flower Shop,” and “gardening seeds” will be included for each product page, helping to increase the likelihood of appearing in relevant search results.

- **Customizable SEO for Individual Products:** Each product page will have its own meta description, ensuring that specific keywords related to the seed or plant category are emphasized. For example, for rose seeds, the description might mention **scientific names** and **specific seed categories**, making it easier for users to find relevant products.

### Promotions & Special Offers

We will run **seasonal promotions** on our Facebook page to drive traffic to the site and increase sales. This will include **discounts**, **special deals on bulk seed purchases**, and **limited-time offers** that encourage repeat visits. These promotions will be supported by SEO-driven content, such as blog posts and product updates, ensuring that customers are always in the loop.

## Deployment of the **Future Flower Shop** Project on Heroku

### What I Have Done

I have successfully deployed the **Future Flower Shop** project to **Heroku** using the **Heroku Dashboard**. Here’s an overview of the steps I followed to get the project running live on Heroku without using the terminal:

#### 1. **Created a Heroku Account**

First, I created an account on Heroku by visiting [Heroku’s official website](https://www.heroku.com/). This allowed me to access the Heroku Dashboard and start managing my applications.

#### 2. **Cloned the Project Repository**

I cloned the **Future Flower Shop** project repository from GitHub to my local machine using Git, just like before. This gave me the project files, but all the deployment setup was done through the Heroku Dashboard instead of the terminal.

#### 3. **Created a New Heroku Application**

In the **Heroku Dashboard**, I clicked on **Create New App**. I gave my app a name, and Heroku automatically assigned a unique URL for it. I chose a name for the app and selected the region (default is fine for most use cases).

#### 4. **Connected My GitHub Repository to Heroku**

In the Heroku Dashboard, under the **Deploy** tab, I connected my GitHub repository to the Heroku app. By doing this, I allowed Heroku to directly access my GitHub repository for deployment.

#### 5. **Enabled Automatic Deploys**

I configured Heroku to automatically deploy my app whenever I pushed updates to the GitHub repository. This was done by enabling **Automatic Deploys** in the **Deploy** tab, ensuring my app is always up-to-date with the latest changes on GitHub.

#### 6. **Set Environment Variables**

I went to the **Settings** tab on the Heroku Dashboard and added the necessary environment variables in the **Config Vars** section. These variables included secret keys, API keys, and any other sensitive data the project required to run properly.

#### 7. **Manually Deployed the Code**

After linking my GitHub repository to Heroku and configuring automatic deploys, I manually triggered the first deployment by clicking on **Deploy Branch**. This allowed Heroku to pull the latest code from my GitHub repository and deploy the app to the web.

#### 8. **Monitored the Application**

Once the deployment was complete, I could monitor the app directly from the **Heroku Dashboard**. I accessed the app's logs through the **Logs** section in the dashboard, which helped me ensure that everything was running smoothly and gave me the ability to troubleshoot any issues that arose.

#### 9. **Opened the Application**

Finally, after the successful deployment, I opened the application in the browser directly from the Heroku Dashboard by clicking on the **Open App** button.

---

### Conclusion

By using the **Heroku Dashboard**, I was able to easily deploy the **Future Flower Shop** project without using the terminal. The Heroku Dashboard provided a user-friendly interface to manage the application, set up environment variables, connect to GitHub, and monitor the app. Now, the project is live and can be accessed by anyone via its Heroku-provided URL.
