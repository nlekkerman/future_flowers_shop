def seed_data(request):
    """
    A function to retrieve and return all seed data from the database.

    This function queries the Seed model to retrieve all seed entries from the database and returns 
    them in a dictionary, which can be used to populate templates or serve as data for API responses.

    Attributes:
        request (HttpRequest): The HTTP request object passed to the view. It is required for this function 
                                to follow the Django view convention, but it is not used directly in this function.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing all the seed entries retrieved from the database. 
              The key 'all_seeds' holds a queryset of all `Seed` objects.
    
    Example:
        seed_data(request)
        # Returns a dictionary like:
        # {'all_seeds': <Queryset of all Seed objects>}

    Notes:
        - The returned `all_seeds` is a QuerySet that contains all the entries from the Seed model.
        - The query does not filter, order, or limit the results. It simply fetches all records.
