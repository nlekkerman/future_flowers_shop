"""
This view handles incoming webhook notifications from Stripe. Webhooks allow Stripe 
to notify the server about events related to payments, such as successful payments, 
failed payments, etc. 

In this implementation, we use Stripe's Webhook API to verify the event's authenticity 
using a signature key and then delegate the event handling to a custom handler class.

- `wh_secret` holds the secret key used to verify Stripeâ€™s event signatures.
- The `event_map` is a dictionary mapping Stripe event types to custom handler methods.
- Each event type, such as 'payment_intent.succeeded', is mapped to a corresponding 
  handler function, which processes the event accordingly.

def webhook(request):
    """
    Handles POST requests from Stripe webhooks. 

    Steps:
        1. Validates the signature to ensure the webhook is sent by Stripe.
        2. Constructs the event object from the request payload.
        3. Retrieves and calls the appropriate handler based on the event type.
        4. Returns an appropriate HTTP response indicating the outcome of handling the event.

    Parameters:
        request (HttpRequest): The incoming HTTP request object containing the payload and signature.
        
    Returns:
        HttpResponse: A response indicating the success or failure of processing the webhook.
