{% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}

<!--
This template is used to render a page where users can edit an existing review on a seed.
- The page is part of a larger base layout, which is extended by `{% extends "base.html" %}`.
- The content block `{% block content %}` defines the content specific to this page.
- Displays a heading "Edit Your Review" to inform the user about the page's purpose.
- The form uses the POST method to submit the updated review.
- `{% csrf_token %}` ensures protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- The form fields are rendered as paragraph tags using `{{ form.as_p }}`.
- A "Save Changes" button allows the user to submit the changes.
- A "Cancel" button links to the seed detail page for the specific seed associated with the review, redirecting the user without saving the changes.
