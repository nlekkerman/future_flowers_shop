"""
This module handles the views for the communications app, which facilitates chat functionality between users and admins (superusers). The following views are implemented:

1. **conversations**: Displays a list of all conversations for the logged-in superuser. The view allows search functionality to filter conversations based on the username of the other user in the conversation. It also tracks unread messages and sorts conversations by the latest message sent.

2. **chat_with_user**: Allows superusers to chat with a selected user. The chat interface displays all messages in the conversation and marks any unread messages as read.

3. **send_message_to_user**: Allows a superuser to send a message to a selected user within an ongoing conversation. The message is sent through a POST request, and the response includes the new message's content, sender, and timestamp.

4. **chat_with_admin**: Allows a regular user to chat with a superuser (admin). The chat interface displays all messages exchanged in the conversation with the admin.

5. **send_message_to_admin**: Allows a regular user to send a message to the superuser (admin). Similar to the `send_message_to_user` view, the message is sent via a POST request, and the response includes the new message details.

6. **contact_view**: Renders the contact page where users can reach out for inquiries or support.

7. **about**: Renders the about page, typically containing general information about the website or company.

8. **faq_view**: Renders the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page, providing answers to common questions users might have about delivery, seed storage, returns, and more.

9. **search_users**: Allows admin users to search for other users by username, returning a list of matching users in JSON format.

The views use Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system to restrict access based on user roles (admin or regular user). They also use Django's ORM to interact with the database models (`Conversation`, `ChatMessage`, `User`).
